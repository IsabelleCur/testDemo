##原文知识摘录
A range of vision tasks: object classification, object detection, face identification, optical flow, and structure from motion.

Recent research has focused on dedicated ASICs for deep learning to reduce the cost of forward inference compared to a GPU or CPU.

Image signal processors(ISP) consist of a series of signal processing stages. While the precise makeup of an ISP pipeline varies, we consider a typical set of stages common to all ISP pipelines: denoising, demosaicing, color transformations, gamut mapping, tone mapping, and image compression.
